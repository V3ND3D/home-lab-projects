# Home Lab & Digital Decentralization Project

## 📌 Summary
Designed and maintained a multi-device security lab focused on privacy, system hardening, and digital sovereignty.

## 🎯 Goals & Purpose
- Build a controlled, secure lab for experimentation with real-world security principles.
- Transition away from centralized tech ecosystems into local-first and privacy-preserving alternatives.

## 🧰 Tech Stack / Tools
- Windows 11 Pro (host OS)
- macOS (host OS)
- Kali Linux (VMs on both platforms)
- ProtonVPN, ProtonDrive, ProtonMail
- PowerShell, Wireshark, VirtualBox/UTM

## 🔧 Features & Milestones
- ✅ Multi-device hardening (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ Full migration to Proton ecosystem (VPN, Drive, Mail)
- ✅ VPN Secure Core routing (Iceland/Switzerland)
- ✅ Account minimization (from 130 → 51)
- ✅ OSINT data exposure analysis (zero confirmed leaks)

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Hardened firewall & DNS
- All sensitive files stored offline or encrypted
- Proton Drive used only for essential cloud sync

## 🚧 Planned Enhancements
- MAC address whitelisting
- Self-hosted VPN
- IDS/IPS deployment
- Wi-Fi auditing & analysis
